# RedLight - Dont disturb other people sleep

It is an iOS-App for iPhone and iPad and it is just and only a ViewController with a slider.
It spends red light and with the slider you can select the brightness.
It should be a relaxing light.
I`ve wrote it for my wife and our Baby. So you have light in the night and dont disturb or awake the Baby too much.
You`l find the App in the AppStore for free without advertisement:
